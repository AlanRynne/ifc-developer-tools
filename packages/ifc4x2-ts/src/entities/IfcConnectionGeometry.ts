/** IfcConnectionGeometry is used to describe the geometric and topological constraints that facilitate the physical connection of two objects.
 *
 * It is envisioned as a control that applies to the element connection relationships
 *
 * The IfcConnectionGeometry allows for the provision of connection constraints between geometric and topological elements, the following connection geometry/topology types are in scope:
