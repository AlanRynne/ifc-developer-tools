/** The element type IfcFlowTerminalType defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow terminal and an optional set of product representations.
 *
 * It is used to define a flow terminal specification (the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type)
 *
 * A flow terminal type is used to define the common properties of a flow terminal that may be applied to many occurrences of that type.
 *
 * A flow terminal acts as a terminus or beginning element in a distribution system such as a ceiling register in a ducted air distribution system, a sink in a waste-water system, or a light fixture in an electrical lighting system.
 *
 * Flow terminal types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences
 *
 * The occurrences of the IfcFlowTerminalType are represented by instances of IfcFlowTerminal or its subtypes.
