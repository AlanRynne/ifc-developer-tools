/** The association relationship IfcRelAssociates refers to sources of information (most notably a classification, library, document, approval, contraint, or material).
 *
 * The information associated may reside internally or externally of the project data.
 *
 * There is no dependency implied by the association.
 *
 * Association relationships can be established to objects (occurrences as subtypes of IfcObject) or to types (as subtypes of IfcTypeObject).
 *
 * Some associations (such as approval, or document) may also be applied to property templates (as subtypes of IfcPropertyDefinition).
 *
 * The association relationship establishs an association between one to many objects or property templates and the associated information.
 *
 * The subtypes of IfcRelAssociates establish the particular semantic meaning of the association relationship.
