/** IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext defines the context that applies to several shape representations of a product being a sub context, sharing the WorldCoordinateSystem, CoordinateSpaceDimension, Precision and TrueNorth attributes with the parent IfcGeometricRepresentationContext
 *
 * The IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext is used to define semantically distinguished representation types for different information content, dependent on the representation view and the target scale.
 *
 * It can be used to control the level of detail of the shape representation that is most applicable to this geometric representation context.
 *
 * In addition the sub context is used to control the later appearance of the IfcShapeRepresentation within a plot view
 *
 * Each IfcProduct can then have several instances of subtypes of IfcRepresentation, each being assigned to a different IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext).
 *
 * The applicable values for the inherited ContextIdentifier attribute shall be identical to the RepresentationIdentifier attrubute defined at IfcShapeRepresentation.
