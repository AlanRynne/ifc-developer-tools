/** The projection element is a specialization of the general feature element to represent projections applied to building elements.
 *
 * It represents a solid attached to any element that has physical manifestation
 *
 * An IfcProjectionElement has to be linked to a element (all subtypes of IfcElement) by using the IfcRelProjectsElement relationship.
 *
 * Its existence depends on the existence of the master element.
 *
 * The relationship implies a Boolean union operation between the volume of the projection element and the volume of the element
 *
 * The IfcProjectionElement shall not participate in the containment relationship, i.e. it is not linked directly to the spatial structure of the project.
 *
 * It has a mandatory ProjectsElements inverse relationship pointing to the IfcElement that is contained in the spatial structure.
