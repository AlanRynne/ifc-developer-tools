/** The building storey has an elevation and typically represents a (nearly) horizontal aggregation of spaces that are vertically bound
 *
 * A storey is (if specified) associated to a building.
 *
 * A storey may span over several connected storeys.
 *
 * Therefore storey complex provides for a collection of storeys included in a building.
 *
 * A storey can also be decomposed in (horizontical) parts, where each part defines a partial storey.
 *
 * This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype IfcSpatialStructureElements which is interpreted as follow:The IfcBuildingStorey is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical).
 *
 * The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates
 *
 * Figure 152 shows the IfcBuildingStorey as part of the s patial structure.
 *
 * It also serves as the spatial container for building and other elements
 *
 * Figure 153 describes the heights and elevations of the IfcBuildingStorey.
