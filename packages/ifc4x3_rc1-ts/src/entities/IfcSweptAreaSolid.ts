/** An IfcSweptAreaSolid represents the 3D shape by a sweeping representation scheme allowing a two dimensional planar cross section to sweep through space
 *
 * The swept area is defined by a cross section, represented by a subtype if IfcProfileDef, that is provided as a closed two-dimensional boundary on an implicit plane.
 *
 * The swept area is defined in the xy plane of the object coordinate system.
 *
 * The sweeping operation is applied to the swept area as defined within the subtypes of IfcSweptAreaSolid, some subtypes require an implicit transformation of the swept area to the start position of the sweep.
 *
 * The optional Position coordinate system allows for re-positioning the resulting swept solid relative to the object coordinate system.
