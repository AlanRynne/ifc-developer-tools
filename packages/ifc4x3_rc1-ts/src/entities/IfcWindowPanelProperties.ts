/** A window panel is a casement, that is, a component, fixed or opening, consisting essentially of a frame and the infilling.
 *
 * The infilling of a window panel is normally glazing.
 *
 * The way of operation is defined in the operation type
 *
 * The IfcWindowPanelProperties are used to parametrically describe the shape and operation of window panels.
 *
 * The parametric definition can be added solely or additionally to the explicit shape representation of the window
 *
 * The IfcWindowType can define windows consisting of more then one panel.
 *
 * In this case, one instance of IfcWindowPanelProperties has to be included for each window panel.
 *
 * The PanelPosition attribute, in conjunction with the IfcWindowType
 *
 * OperationType attribute, determines to which panel the IfcWindowPanelPropertiesapply.
 *
 * The IfcWindowPanelProperties are included in the list of properties (HasPropertySets) of the IfcWindowStyle.
 *
 * More information about the window panel can be included in the same list of the IfcWindowType using the IfcPropertySet for dynamic extensions
 *
 * The IfcWindowPanelProperties does not hold an own geometric representation.
 *
 * However it defines parameter, which can be used to create the shape of the IfcWindowType (which is inserted by the IfcWindow into the spatial context of the project).
 *
 * The parameters at the IfcWindowPanelProperties define a standard window panel.
 *
 * The outer boundary of the lining is determined by the 'Profile' shape representation assigned to the IfcWindow, which inserts the IfcWindowType.
 *
 * It has to take the lining parameter into account as well.
 *
 * The position of the window panel within the overall window is determined by the PanelPosition attribute
 *
 * As shown in Figure 300, the panel is applied to the position within the lining as defined by the panel position attribute.
 *
 * The following parameter apply to that panel: FrameDepth, FrameThickness.
