/** The door is a building element that is predominately used to provide controlled access for people and goods.
 *
 * It includes constructions with hinged, pivoted, sliding, and additionally revolving and folding operations.
 *
 * A door consists of a lining and one or several panels
 *
 * The IfcDoor defines a particular occurrence of a door inserted in the spatial context of a project.
 *
 * A door can:This specification provides two entities for door occurrences:The actual parameters of the door and/or its shape are defined by the IfcDoor as the occurrence definition (or project instance), or by the IfcDoorType as the specific definition (or project type).
 *
 * The following parameters are given:The geometric representation of IfcDoor is given by the IfcProductDefinitionShape, allowing multiple geometric representations.
 *
 * The IfcDoor may get its parameter and shape from the IfcDoorType.
 *
 * If an IfcRepresentationMap (a block definition) is defined for the IfcDoorType, then the IfcDoor inserts it through the IfcMappedItem
 *
 * The geometric representation of IfcDoor is defined using the following (potentially multiple) IfcShapeRepresentation's for its IfcProductDefinitionShape:In addition the parametric representation of a (limited) door shape is available by applying the parameters from IfcDoorType referencing IfcDoorLiningProperties and IfcDoorPanelProperties.
 *
 * The purpose of the parameter is described at those entities and below (door opening operation by door type)
 *
 * The overall size of the IfcDoor to be used to apply the lining or panel parameter provided by the IfcDoorType is determined by the IfcShapeRepresentation with the RepresentationIdentifier = 'Profile'.
