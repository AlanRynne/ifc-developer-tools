/** IfcElementType defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of an element and an optional set of product representations.
 *
 * It is used to define an element specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).
 *
 * An element type is used to define the common properties of a certain type or style of an element that may be applied to instances of that element type to assign a specific style.
 *
 * Element types (the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.
