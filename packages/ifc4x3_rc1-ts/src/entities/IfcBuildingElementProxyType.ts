/** IfcBuildingElementProxyType defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a building element proxy and an optional set of product representations.
 *
 * It is used to define an element specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).
 *
 * A building element proxy type is used to define the common properties of a certain type of a building element proxy that may be applied to many instances of that type to assign a specific style.
 *
 * Building element proxy types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.
 *
 * The occurrences of the IfcBuildingElementProxyType are represented by instances of IfcBuildingElementProxy.
