/** The element type IfcFlowMovingDeviceType defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow moving device and an optional set of product representations.
 *
 * It is used to define a flow moving device specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type)
 *
 * A flow moving type is used to define the common properties of a flow moving device that may be applied to many occurrences of that type.
 *
 * A flow moving device is a device that is used to produce a pressure differential in a distribution system, such as a pump, fan, or compressor.
 *
 * Flow moving types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences
 *
 * The occurrences of the IfcFlowMovingDeviceType are represented by instances of IfcFlowMovingDevice or its subtypes.
