/** The IfcGeometricRepresentationContext defines the context that applies to several shape representations of products within a project.
 *
 * It defines the type of the context in which the shape representation is defined, and the numeric precision applicable to the geometric representation items defined in this context.
 *
 * In addition it can be used to offset the project coordinate system from a global point of origin, using the WorldCoordinateSystem attribute.
 *
 * The main representation context may also provide the true north direction, see Figure 437
 *
 * The use of one instance of IfcGeometricRepresentationContext to represent the model (3D) view is mandatory, the use of a second instance of IfcGeometricRepresentationContext to represent the plan (2D) view is optional (but needs to be given, if there are scale dependent plan views), the additional scale or view dependent contexts need to be handled by using the subtype IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext pointing to the model view (or the plan view) as the ParentContext.
 *
 * See Figure 438 for an example using geometric representation contexts for 3D and 2D with assigned sub contexts.
