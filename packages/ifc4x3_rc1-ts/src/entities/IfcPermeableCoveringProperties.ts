/** This entity is a description of a panel within a door or window (as fillers for opening) which allows for air flow.
 *
 * It is given by its properties (IfcPermeableCoveringProperties).
 *
 * A permeable covering is a casement, such as a component, fixed or opening, consisting essentially of a frame and the infilling.
 *
 * The infilling is normally a grill, a louver or a screen.
 *
 * The way of operation is defined in the operation type
 *
 * The IfcPermeableCoveringProperties are included in the list of properties (HasPropertySets) of the IfcWindowStyle or the IfcDoorStyle.
 *
 * More information about the permeable covering can be included in the same list of the window or door style using the IfcPropertySet for dynamic extensions.
 *
 * This particularly applies for additional properties for the various operation typesThe IfcPermeableCoveringProperties does not hold a geometric representation.
 *
 * However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the IfcWindowStyle (which is inserted by the IfcWindow into the spatial context of the project), or of the IfcDoorStyle (which is inserted by the IfcDoor)
 *
 * The parameters at the IfcPermeableCoveringProperties define a standard permeable covering.
 *
 * The outer boundary of the panel is determined by the occurrence parameter assigned to the IfcWindow or IfcDoor.
 *
 * It has to take the lining parameter into account as well.
 *
 * The position of the permeable covering within the overall window or door is determined by the PanelPosition attribute
 *
 * Figure 298 illustrates the panel applied to the position within the lining, as defined by the panel position attribute.
 *
 * The following parameters apply to that panel: FrameDepth, FrameThickness.
