# IFC2X3 Typescript

This package holds all IFC classes corresponding to version *IFC2X3*.

It was auto-generated using `ifc-syntax-codegen`, part of the **IFC Developer Tools** developed by [Alan Rynne](https://github.com/alanrynne).

These package is currently **under development** and most of the IFC functions, rules and validation have no implementation. Pending future releases!
