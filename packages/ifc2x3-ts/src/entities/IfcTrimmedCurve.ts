/** An IfcTrimmedCurve is a bounded curve that is trimmed at both ends.
 *
 * The trimming points may be provided by a Cartesian point or by a parameter value, based on the parameterization of the BasisCurve.
 *
 * The SenseAgreement attribute indicates whether the direction of the IfcTrimmedCurve agrees with or is opposed to the direction of the BasisCurve
 *
 * Figure 382 shows the four arcs (dashed blue and green lines with arrow showing different orientations) that can be defined by the same BasisCurve (of type IfcCircle) and the same trimming points (given by Cartesian points and parameter values) by using different assignments to Trim1 and Trim2 and SenseAgreement
