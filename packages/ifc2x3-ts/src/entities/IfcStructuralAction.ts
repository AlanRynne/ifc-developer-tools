/** A structural action is a structural activity that acts upon a structural item or building element
 *
 * Relationship use definitionStructural actions are grouped into either an IfcStructuralLoadGroup of predefined type LOAD_GROUP or, more often, an IfcStructuralLoadCase.
 *
 * This is accomplished via the inverse relationship HasAssignments and an IfcRelAssignsToGroup relationship object.
 *
 * IfcStructuralLoadGroup
 *
 * LoadGroupFor or IfcStructuralLoadCase
 *
 * LoadGroupFor respectively refers to the structural analysis model(s) in which the loads are used
 *
 * It is furthermore possible to establish relationships between actions in one analysis model and reactions in another analysis model which cause the actions.
 *
 * For example, a support reaction from one structural system may be taken over as a load onto another supporting structural system.
 *
 * This is expressed by means of the inverse relationship ReferencedBy of the action and an IfcRelAssignsToProduct relationship object.
 *
 * IfcRelAssignsToProduct
 *
 * Name is set to 'Causes' and IfcRelAssignsToProduct
 *
 * RelatedObjects refers to an instance of a subtype of IfcStructuralReaction.
