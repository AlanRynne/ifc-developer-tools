/** The IfcDistributionElementType defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of an element and an optional set of product representations.
 *
 * It is used to define an element specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).
 *
 * A distribution element type is used to define the common properties of a certain type of a distribution element that may be applied to many instances of that feature type to assign a specific style.
 *
 * Distribution element types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.
 *
 * The occurrences of the IfcDistributionElementType are represented by instances of IfcDistributionElement (or its subtypes).
