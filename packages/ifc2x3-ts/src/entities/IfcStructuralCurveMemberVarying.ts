/** This entity describes edge members with varying profile properties.
 *
 * Each instance of IfcStructuralCurveMemberVarying is composed of two or more instances of IfcStructuralCurveMember with differing profile properties.
 *
 * These subordinate members relate to the instance of IfcStructuralCurveMemberVarying by IfcRelAggregates
 *
 * Coordinate Systems:See definitions at IfcStructuralItem and IfcStructuralCurveMember.
 *
 * The local coordinates of the aggregate are derived from those of its parts.
 *
 * Length measures in local x direction of the aggregate depend on continuity and lengths of the parts.
 *
 * The Axis of the aggregate shal be the same as the Axis of the part at the start of the aggregate
 *
 * Material Use DefinitionOnly the individual parts (direct instances of IfcStructuralCurveMember) carry material and profile information.
