/** IfcRelVoidsElement is an objectified relationship between a building element and one opening element that creates a void in the element.
 *
 * It is a one-to-one relationship.
 *
 * This relationship implies a Boolean operation of subtraction between the geometric bodies of the element and the opening
 *
 * As shown in Figure 179, the insertion of a void into a wall is represented by the relationship IfcRelVoidsElement.
 *
 * The opening is created within the wall by IfcWall(StandardCase) o-- IfcRelVoidsElement --o IfcOpeningElement.
