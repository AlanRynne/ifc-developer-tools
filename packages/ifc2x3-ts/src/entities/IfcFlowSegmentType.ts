/** The element type IfcFlowSegmentType defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow segment and an optional set of product representations.
 *
 * It is used to define a flow segment specification (the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type)
 *
 * A flow segment type is used to define the common properties of a flow segment that may be applied to many occurrences of that type.
 *
 * A flow segment is a section of a distribution system, such as a duct, pipe, or conduit, that typically has only two ports.
 *
 * Flow segment types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences
 *
 * Occurrences of the IfcFlowSegmentType are represented by instances of IfcFlowSegment or its subtypes.
