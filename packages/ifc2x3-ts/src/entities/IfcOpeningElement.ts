/** The opening element stands for opening, recess or chase, all reflecting voids.
 *
 * It represents a void within any element that has physical manifestation.
 *
 * Openings can be inserted into walls, slabs, beams, columns, or other elements
 *
 * The IFC specification provides two entities for opening elements:There are two different types of opening elements:The attribute PredefinedType should be used to capture the differences,An IfcOpeningElement has to be inserted into an IfcElement by using the IfcRelVoidsElement relationship.
 *
 * It may be filled by an IfcDoor, IfcWindow, or another filling element by using the relationship IfcRelFillsElements.
 *
 * Depending on the type of the IfcShapeRepresentation of the IfcOpeningElement the voiding relationship implies:The IfcOpeningElement shall not participate in the containment relationship, i.e. it is not linked directly to the spatial structure of the project.
 *
 * It has a mandatory VoidsElements inverse relationship pointing to the IfcElement that is contained in the spatial structure.
