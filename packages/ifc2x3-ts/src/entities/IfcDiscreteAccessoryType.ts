/** The element component type IfcDiscreteAccessoryType defines commonly shared information for occurrences of discrete accessorys.
 *
 * The set of shared information may include: It is used to define a discrete accessory type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type.
 *
 * The IfcDiscreteAccessoryType may be declared within IfcProject or IfcProjectLibrary using IfcRelDeclares and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type.
 *
 * Occurrences of IfcDiscreteAccessoryType are represented by instances of IfcDiscreteAccessory
 *
 * Type Use Definition The exact type information of the IfcDiscreteAccessoryType is given in the PredefinedType attribute, possibly in combination with the ElementType attribute inherited from IfcElementType.
 *
 * Standard ElementType designations are provided for guideline below.
 *
 * The list is not exhaustive and the list of definitions may be extended based on local agreements.
