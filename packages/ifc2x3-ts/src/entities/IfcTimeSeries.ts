/** A time series is a set of a time-stamped data entries.
 *
 * It allows a natural association of data collected over intervals of time.
 *
 * Time series can be regular or irregular.
 *
 * In regular time series data arrive predictably at predefined intervals.
 *
 * In irregular time series some or all time stamps do not follow a repetitive pattern and unpredictable bursts of data may arrive at unspecified points in time
 *
 * The modeling of buildings and their performance involves data that are generated and recorded over a period of time.
 *
 * Such data cover a large spectrum, from weather data to schedules of all kinds to status measurements to reporting to everything else that has a time related aspect.
 *
 * Their correct placement in time is essential for their proper understanding and use, and the IfcTimeSeries subtypes provide the appropriate data structures to accommodate these types of data.
