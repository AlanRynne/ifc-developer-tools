/** The IfcMaterialLayerSet is a designation by which materials of an element constructed of a number of material layers is known and through which the relative positioning of individual layers can be expressed
 *
 * The Material Layer Set Base (MlsBase) describes the imaginary axis along which the material layers are positioned
 *
 * Attribute use definitionAs shown in Figure 385, each IfcMaterialLayerSet implicitly defines a material layer set base line (MlsBase), to which the start of the first IfcMaterialLayer is aligned.
 *
 * The total thickness of a layer set is calculated from the individual layer thicknesses, the first layer starting from the MlsBase and following layers being placed on top of the previous (no gaps or overlaps).
