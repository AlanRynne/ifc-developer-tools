/** The IfcCurveStyleFontAndScaling allows for the reuse of the same curve style definition in several sizes.
 *
 * The definition of the CurveFontScale is the scaling of a base curve style pattern to be used as a new or derived curve style pattern
 *
 * An example for IfcCurveStyleFontAndScaling is the sizing of a basic curve style dash pattern 'dash' (visible 0.01m, invisible 0.005m) into 'dash large' with CurveFontScale = 2 (resulting in visible 0.02m, invisible 0.01m), and into 'dash small' with CurveFontScale = 0.5 (resulting in visible 0.005m, invisible 0.0025m).
