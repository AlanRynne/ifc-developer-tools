/** A building represents a structure that provides shelter for its occupants or contents and stands in one place.
 *
 * The building is also used to provide a basic element within the spatial structure hierarchy for the components of a building project (together with site, storey, and space)
 *
 * A building is (if specified) associated to a site.
 *
 * A building may span over several connected or disconnected buildings.
 *
 * Therefore building complex provides for a collection of buildings included in a site.
 *
 * A building can also be decomposed in (vertical) parts, where each part defines a building section.
 *
 * This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype IfcSpatialStructureElements which is interpreted as follow:The IfcBuilding is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical).
 *
 * The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates.
 *
 * Figure 150 shows the IfcBuilding as part of the spatial structure.
 *
 * It also serves as the spatial container for building and other elements.
 *
 * Systems, such as building service or electrical distribution systems, zonal systems, or structural analysis systems, relate to IfcBuilding by using the objectified relationship IfcRelServicesBuildings.
 *
 * Figure 151 describes the heights and elevations of the IfcBuilding.
 *
 * It is used to provide the height above sea level of the project height datum for this building, that is, the internal height 0.00.
 *
 * The height 0.00 is often used as a building internal reference height and equal to the floor finish level of the ground floor.
