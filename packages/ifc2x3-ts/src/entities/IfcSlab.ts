/** A slab is a component of the construction that may enclose a space vertically.
 *
 * The slab may provide the lower support (floor) or upper construction (roof slab) in any space in a building.
 *
 * Only the core or constructional part of this construction is considered to be a slab.
 *
 * The upper finish (flooring, roofing) and the lower finish (ceiling, suspended ceiling) are considered to be coverings.
 *
 * A special type of slab is the landing, described as a floor section to which one or more stair flights or ramp flights connect
 *
 * A slab may have openings, such as floor openings, or recesses.
 *
 * They are defined by an IfcOpeningElement attached to the slab using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to IfcRelVoidsElement
 *
 * There are three entities for slab occurrences:
