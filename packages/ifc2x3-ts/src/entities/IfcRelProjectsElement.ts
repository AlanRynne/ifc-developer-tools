/** The IfcRelProjectsElement is an objectified relationship between an element and one projection element that creates a modifier to the shape of the element.
 *
 * The relationship is defined to be a 1:1 relationship, if an element has more than one projection, several relationship objects have to be used, each pointing to a different projection element.
 *
 * The IfcRelProjectsElement establishes an aggregation relationship between the main element and a sub ordinary addition feature
 *
 * The IfcRelProjectsElement implies a Boolean operation of addition for the geometric bodies of the element and the feature element.
 *
 * As with all decomposition relationships it determines:
