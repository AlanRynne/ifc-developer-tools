 * Thereby shape representations of components of the product shape represent a distinctive part to a product that can be explicitly addressed
 *
 * The IfcShapeAspect's may have distinct material information or other distict characteristics that differs from other parts of the product shape representation

 * Figure 439 indicates the association of material characteristics to shape aspects
