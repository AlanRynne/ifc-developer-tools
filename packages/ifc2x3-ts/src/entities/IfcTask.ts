/** An IfcTask is an identifiable unit of work to be carried out in a construction project
 *
 * A task is typically used to describe an activity for the construction or installation of products, but is not limited to these types.
 *
 * For example it might be used to describe design processes, move operations and other design, construction and operation related activities as well.
 *
 * Quantities of resources consumed by the task are dealt with by defining the IfcElementQuantity for the resource and not at the instance of IfcTask
 *
 * Attribute use definition Each occurrence of IfcTask is given a name that is indicative of its content (IfcRoot.Name).
 *
 * A textual description of the task may be provided and this may be further elaborated by a narrative long description (IfcProcess.LongDescription).
 *
 * A work method may be declared for the method of work used in carrying out a task.
 *
 * A task is identified as being either a milestone task or not.
 *
 * A milestone task is defined by the marker IsMilestone.
 *
 * and has no duration.
 *
 * A status and priority for each task may also be set.
 *
 * Time and duration use definition Compared to previous IFC releases, basic task time information (scheduled start time, scheduled finish time, duration) is now directly attached to IfcTask through the TaskTime attribute.
 *
 * Regular tasks are defined through IfcTaskTime.
 *
 * Recurring tasks are defined through IfcTaskTimeRecurring.
 *
 * In case a regular task is derived from a recurring task both tasks should be linked together through a IfcRelNests relationship, where IfcRelNests
 *
 * IsNestedBy points to the recurring task and IfcRelNests
 *
 * Nests points to all regular tasks that have been derived from the recurring task.
 *
 * Representation of other activities The use definitions for IfcTask have been generalised to represent other activities as well, including activities that had been defined by own entities in previous IFC releases.
 *
 * This includes IfcTask represents an order that might be carried out by a Helpdesk acting the role of interface for the organization between the facility user and the functional requirement of fulfilling their needs.
 *
 * The actual task represented by the IfcTask entity is turning a request into an order and initiating the action that will enable the order to be completed.
 *
 * The IfcProjectOrder or one of its subtypes including maintenance work order, is related to the IfcTask using IfcRelAssignsToControl.
 *
 * IfcTask can also be used to describe an activity that moves people, groups within an organization or complete organizations together with their associated furniture and equipment from one place to another.
 *
 * It thus replaces the previous IFC entity IfcMove.
 *
 * The functionality is represented in IfcTask as follows:
